                    The origin of the first Diablo came from David Brevik while at Condor Games around 1994. Brevik was heavily inspired by the roguelike genre with turn-based combat, but with simplified role-playing game elements and a more expansive loot system.The name Diablo was based on Mount Diablo, which was where Brevik lived when he conceived the game idea.

                    Diablo was a top selling game in 1997 with over a million copies sold that year, leading Blizzard to announce its sequel, Diablo II. The sequel, while retaining much of the same gameplay as the original title, used very little of the original code, and had no formal design approach. Released in June 2000, Diablo II sold over 2 million copies within a month and a half of release, and reached four million a year later.
